```R
# Corrected code to properly subset the data frame based on the condition.
# The parenthesis ensures the AND operation is evaluated correctly.

df <- data.frame(a = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), b = c(6, 7, 8, 9, 10))

# Correct subsetting
result <- df[(df$a > 2) & (df$b < 9), ]
print(result)

# Explanation:
# The original code had an issue with operator precedence and how R evaluates logical statements.
# The parenthesis in the corrected code explicitly define the order of evaluation
# ensuring that the conditions are checked independently before the AND operation is applied.
